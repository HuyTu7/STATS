We are 99% confident that the true proportion of household in the US has a cat is between 31.8 percent and 32.9 percent. 

This method has a coverage probability of 99%

Small p-value so we shall then reject the null hypothesis
*$H_o$: $\pi_1$  = $\pi_2$  = $\pi_3$  = $\pi_4$*     
*$H_a$: not all $\pi$'s the same*
You can't have pratical differences from difference that arent' significant.
