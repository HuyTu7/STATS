###Investigation 1.17: Cat Households

**(a)** Identify the observational units and variable of interest.

Observational units: *47,000 households*

Variable of interest: *pet that the households own*

**(b)** Is 32.4% a parameter or a statistic? Indicate the symbol used to represent it.

*32.4% is a statistic which is indicated as $\hat{p}$*

**(c)** Conduct a test of whether the sample data provide evidence that the population proportion who own a pet cat differs from one-third. State the hypotheses, and report the test statistic and p-value. State your test decision at the $\alpha$ = 0.01 level, and summarize your conclusion in the context of this study.
```{r}
n <- 47000
p_hat <- 0.324
pi <- 1/3 
testS <- (p_hat - pi)/sqrt(pi*(1-pi)/n) #Finding Test Statistics
subjects <- p_hat*n #The number of households that own cat as pet
alpha <- 0.01
pVal <- prop.test(subjects, n, p = pi, conf.level = alpha, correct = FALSE)$p.value #Finding p-value
```
*$H_o$: the population proportion who own a pet cat equals to one-third.*   
*Null hypothesis symbol: $\pi$ = $\frac{1}{3}$ = `r pi`*    
*$H_a$: the population proportion who own a pet cat differs from one-third.*    
*Alternative hypothesis symbol: $\pi \neq$ $\frac{1}{3}$* 

*Test statistic which is indicated as $z_0 = `r testS`$*
*P-value is $`r pVal`$ which is less than 0.01. Therefore, this p-value is strongly significant and we can reject the null hypothesis that the population proportion is equal to one-third and accept the alternative hypothesis.*


**(d)** Explain why the p-value turns out to be so very small, when the sample proportion of households with a cat seems to be quite close to one-third.

*The p-value is so small because the sample size is so large, 47000 households even when the sample proportion of households with a cat seems to be quite close to one-third.*


**(e)** Produce a 99% confidence interval (CI) for the population proportion who own a pet cat. Interpret this interval.
```{r}
library(binom)
#Finding 99% confidence interval
binom.confint(x=subjects, n = 47000, conf =.99)
```

*We are 99% confident that the true proportion of household in the US has a cat is between 31.8 percent and 32.9 percent.* 

**(f)** Is the confidence interval consistent with the test decision? Explain.

*Yes, both techniques reach the same conclusion that the proportion of US households that have a cat is not $\frac{1}{3}$.*


**(g)** Do the sample data provide very strong evidence that the population proportion who own a pet cat is not one-third? Explain whether the p-value or the CI helps you to decide.

*Yes, the p-value is extremely small.*


**(h)** Do the sample data provide strong evidence that the population proportion who own a pet cat is very different from one-third? Explain whether the p-value or the CI helps you to decide.

*No. Confidence interval is close to $\frac{1}{3}$. That give us strong evidence.*

###Investigation 1.18: Female Senators
(a) Use this sample information to form a 95% confidence interval for the actual proportion of all humans who are female.
```{r}
#Finding 95% confidence interval
conf_int <- binom.confint(x=20, n = 100, conf =.95)
conf_int
```


(b) Is this confidence interval a reasonable estimate of the actual proportion of all humans who are female?

*It is not a reasonable estimate of the actual proportion of all humans who are female.*


(c) Explain why the confidence interval procedure fails to produce an accurate estimate of the population parameter in this situation. 

*The sample is collected from the population in a biased manner since senators are usually composed of males. Therefore, the ensuing confidence interval will be a biased, and potentially misleading, estimate of the population parameter of interest.*

*Moreover, when the data at hand constitute the entire population of interest, then constructing a confidence interval from these data is meaningless.* 


(d) It clearly does not make sense to use the confidence interval in (a) to estimate the proportion of women on Earth or even the U.S., but does the interval make sense for estimating the proportion of women in the 2015 U.S. Senate? Explain your answer.

*The interval does not make sense for estimating the propotion of women in the 2015 U.S. Senate. The 2015 U.S. Senate is the population and not the sample for this problem and $\pi = 0.2$ is given from the problem. Therefore, we do not use the confidence interval to estimate the proportion of women in the 2015 U.S. Senate.*

###SUMMARY

*Chapter eigth focuses heavily on having code chunks in our presentation documents through more detail key $knitr$ syntax. Incorporating analyses into markup, dynamically including modular analysis files, reproducibly random through set.seed, and computationally intensive analyses are the big four topics that were covered. The example below shows how set.seed as a function to produce reproducible random.*
```{r}
set.seed(43)
#randomly draw 500 numbers with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 3
Draw1 <-  rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 3)
#randomly draw 17 numbers in Draw1 
s1 <- sample(Draw1, size=17, replace = FALSE)
summary(s1)

set.seed(43)
#randomly draw 500 numbers with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 3
Draw2 <-  rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 3)
#randomly draw 17 numbers in Draw2
s2 <- sample(Draw2, size=17, replace = FALSE)
summary(s2)

```

*Chapter ninth introduces us to take the output from our statistical analysis and present the results with tables. The tables were dynamically present in LaTeX and Markdown documents with knitr/rmarkdown. The author guided you through that process exploring basic knitr syntax for tables, table basics in LaTex/rmarkdown/HTML, and tables construction from supported class R objects. The example below shows how to construct a data table dynamically using knitr.* 
```{r}
library(knitr)
#Creating data frame variable named "table" 
table <- data.frame(
          Subjects = c("Miley", "Katherine", "Cam", "John", "Jose"),
          Age = c("22", "35", "19", "28", "31"),
          Gender = c("male", "transgender", "female", "female", "male"),
          AlcoholAddiction = c("No", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "No")
)
#Constructing data frame table
kable(table, caption = "Kable Example:")
```


*Instead of tables, chapter tenth helps the readers to take other information that they learnt from the data along with the results from the statistical analyses to present those information dynamically in figures. The author guided you through that process by invesigating how to include non-knitted graphics in rmarkdown/html/LaTeX, basic knitr/rmarkdown figure options, and knitting R's default graphics. The figure below was included by using LaTeX syntax.*
